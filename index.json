The Pandas command pd.read_sql As of 2022, the %sql magic for Jupyter Notebooks is still in development (check out its GitHub. It is still missing many features that would justify real-world use with Python. In particular, its returned tables are not Pandas dataframes (for example, the query result from the above cell is missing an index). The rest of this section describes how data scientists use SQL and Python in practice, using the Pandas command pd.read_sql (documentation). You will see both %sql magic and pd.read_sql in this course. The below cell connects to the same database using the SQLAlchemy Python library, which can connect to several different database management systems, including sqlite3, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle. The library also supports an advanced feature for generating queries called an object relational mapper or ORM, which we won’t discuss in this course but is quite useful for application development. # important!!! run this cell import sqlalchemy # create a SQL Alchemy connection to the database engine = sqlalchemy.create_engine(\"sqlite:///imdbmini.db\") connection = engine.connect() With the SQLAlchemy object connection, we can then call pd.read_sql which takes in a query string.

A suggested workflow for writing SQL in Jupyter Notebooks Which approach is better, %sql magic or pd.read_sql? The SQL database generally contains much more data than what you would analyze in detail. As a Python-fluent data scientist, you will often query SQL databases to perform initial exploratory data analysis, a subset of which you load into Python for further processing. In practice, you would likely use a combination of the two approaches. First, you’d try out some SQL queries with %sql magic to get an interesting subset of data. Then, you’d copy over the query into a pd.read_sql command for visualization, modeling, and export with Pandas, sklearn, and other Python libraries. For SQL assignments in this course, to minimize unruly error messages while maximizing Python compatibility, we suggest the following “sandboxed” workflow: Create a %%sql magic cell below the answer cell. You can copy in the below code: %% sql -- This is a comment. Put your code here... -- Work on the SQL query in the %%sql cell; e.g., SELECT ... ; Then, once you’re satisfied with your SQL query, copy it into the multi-string query in the answer cell (the one that contains the pd.read_sql call). You don’t have to follow the above workflow to get full credit on assignments, but we suggest it to reduce debugging headaches. We’ve created the scratchwork %%sql cells for you in this assignment, but do not add cells between this %%sql cell and the Python cell right below it. It will cause errors when we run the autograder, and it will sometimes cause a failure to generate the PDF file. Part 1: The IMDb (mini) Dataset Let’s explore a miniature version of the IMDb Dataset. This is the same dataset that we will use for the upcoming homework. Let’s load in the database in two ways (using both Python and cell magic) so that we can flexibly explore the database. engine = sqlalchemy.create_engine(\"sqlite:///imdbmini.db\") connection = engine.connect() %sql sqlite:///imdbmini.db %%sql SELECT * FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'; * sqlite:///imdbmini.db\rDone.\rtype\rname\rtbl_name\rrootpage\rsql\rtable\rTitle\rTitle\r2\rCREATE TABLE \"Title\" ( \"tconst\" INTEGER, \"titleType\" TEXT, \"primaryTitle\" TEXT, \"originalTitle\" TEXT, \"isAdult\" TEXT, \"startYear\" TEXT, \"endYear\" TEXT, \"runtimeMinutes\" TEXT, \"genres\" TEXT )\rtable\rName\rName\r12\rCREATE TABLE \"Name\" ( \"nconst\" INTEGER, \"primaryName\" TEXT, \"birthYear\" TEXT, \"deathYear\" TEXT, \"primaryProfession\" TEXT )\rtable\rRole\rRole\r70\rCREATE TABLE \"Role\" ( tconst INTEGER, ordering TEXT, nconst INTEGER, category TEXT, job TEXT, characters TEXT )\rtable\rRating\rRating\r41\rCREATE TABLE \"Rating\" ( tconst INTEGER, averageRating TEXT, numVotes TEXT )\rFrom running the above cell, we see the database has 4 tables: Name, Role, Rating, and Title.

On race day, you want to know how many people participated in this year’s race, but you don’t have access to the official head count. So you want to find an estimator for this population maximum (Note: we artificially generated this data, but assume it is the population data as described). The bib numbers of each participant (i.e., racer) are in order of registration—integers from $1$ to the total unknown number of participants. You decide to construct a sample by recording the bib number of every racer you see on the street in a given time period, and use the maximum bib number in your sample as an estimator for the true maximum bib number (i.e., total number of particpants, assuming everyone who registered participated). Assume that a racer’s bib number has no relation to their racing experience, so that you are equally likely to see any of bib number in your sample. Is the sample maximum a good estimator for the population maximum? We’ll use simulation to explore in this part of the lab. Note: In Part 1 of this lab, we assume that we have access to the true population of racers (and therefore the parameter, the true population maximum), so that we can evaluate the sample maximum across all possible samples. However, in practice we don’t have access to the population, nor the population parameter. In Part 2, we’ll explore the analysis we can do if just provided a single sample.

A straightforward approach is to map some of these non-numerical features into numerical ones. For example, we can treat the day as a value from 1-7. However, one of the disadvantages in directly translating to a numeric value is that we unintentionally assign certain features disproportionate weight. Consider assigning Sunday to the numeric value of 7, and Monday to the numeric value of 1. In our linear model, Sunday will have 7 times the influence of Monday, which can lower the accuracy of our model. Instead, let’s use one-hot encoding to better represent these features! As you will learn in lecture, one-hot encoding is a way that we can produce a binary vector to indicate non-numeric features. In the tips dataset for example, we encode Sunday as the vector [0 0 0 1] because our dataset only contains bills from Thursday through Sunday. This assigns a more even weight across each category in non-numeric features. Complete the code below to one-hot encode our dataset.

Specifically, we’re going to model the relationship of our data by: $$\\Large{ f_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta(x)}} = \\theta_1x + sin(\\theta_2x) }$$ Our model is parameterized by both $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$, which we can represent in the vector, $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$. Note that a general sine function $a\\sin(bx+c)$ has three parameters: amplitude scaling parameter $a$, frequency parameter $b$ and phase shifting parameter $c$. Here, we’re assuming the amplitude $a$ is around 1, and the phase shifting parameter $c$ is around zero. We do not attempt to justify this assumption and you’re welcome to see what happens if you ignore this assumption at the end of this lab. You might ask why we don’t just create a linear model like we did earlier with a sinusoidal feature. The issue is that the theta is INSIDE the sin function. In other words, linear models use their parameters to adjust the scale of each feature, but $\\theta_2$ in this model adjusts the frequency of the feature. There are tricks we could play to use our linear model framework here, but we won’t attempt this in our lab.

Note that on your plot, the x-axis is in the inverse of complexity! In other words, small alpha models (on the left) are complex, because there is no regularization. That’s why the training error is lowest on the left side of the plot, as this is where overfitting occurs. px.line(error_vs_alpha, x = \"alpha\", y = [\"Training Error\", \"Holdout Error\"], log_x=True) From the plot above, what is the best alpha to use? training error尽可能小，同时hold-out error尽可能小 ==\u003e 0.01~1左右 ","date":"2024-08-13","objectID":"/datalab8/:2:3","tags":["Scikit-Learn"],"title":"DATA100-lab8: Model Selection, Regularization, and Cross-Validation","uri":"/datalab8/"},{"categories":["DATA100"],"content":"REMINDER: Test Set vs. Validation Set (a.k.a. Development Set) In the plots above, we trained our models on a training set, and plotted the resulting RMSE on the training set in blue. We also held out a set of data, and plotted the error on this holdout set in red, calling it the “holdout set error”. For the example above, since we used the holdout set to pick a hyperparameter, we’d call the holdout set a “validation set” or “development set”. These terms are exactly synonomous. It would not be accurate to call this line the “test set error”, because we did not use this dataset as a test set. While it is true that your code never supplied X_test3 or Y_test3 to the fit function of the ridge regression models, once you decide to use the holdout set to select between different models, different hyperparameters, or different sets of features, then we are not using that dataset as a “test set”. That is, since we’ve used this holdout set for picking alpha, the resulting errors are no longer unbiased predictors of our performance on unseen models – the true error on an unseen dataset is likely to be somewhat higher than the validation set. After all, we trained 40 models and picked the best one! In many real world contexts, model builders will split their data into three sets: training, validation, and test sets, where the test set is only ever used once. That is, there are two holdout sets: One used as a development set (for model selection), and one used a test set (for providing an unbiased estimate of error).

Another approach is K-fold cross validation. This allows us to use more data for training instead of having to set aside some specifically for hyperparameter selection. However, doing so requires more computation resources as we’ll have to fit K models per hyperparameter choice. In our course Data 100, there’s really no reason not to use cross validation. However, in environments where models are very expensive to train (e.g. deep learning), you’ll typically prefer using a holdout set (simple cross validation) rather than K-fold cross validation. To emphasize what K-fold cross validation actually means, we’re going to manually carry out the procedure. Recall the approach looks something like the figure below for 4-fold cross validation: When we use K-fold cross validation, rather than using a held out set for model selection, we instead use the training set for model selection. To select between various features, various models, or various hyperparameters, we split the training set further into multiple temporary train and validation sets (each split is called a “fold”, hence k-fold cross validation). We will use the average validation error across all k folds to make our optimal feature, model, and hyperparameter choices. In this example, we’ll only use this procedure for hyperparameter selection, specifically to choose the best alpha.

More technically, the function is nice because it is convex, a property of functions that we will discuss later in the course. Local minima: minimize isn’t perfect. For example, if we give it a function with many valleys (also known as local minima) it can get stuck.

Our L2 Loss and Mean Squared Error are therefore: \\begin{align} \\large L_2(y, \\hat{y}) = \\large (y - \\hat{y})^2 \u0026= \\large (y - (a + bx))^2 \\ \\large R(a, b) = \\large \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n L(y_i, \\hat{y_i}) \u0026= \\large \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i = 1}^n(y_i - (a + b x_i))^2 \\end{align} Notice that because our model is now the linear model $\\hat{y} = a + bx$, our final expressions for Loss and MSE are different from Part A.

Extra Notes Our Observations on Constant Model vs Linear Model Earlier in this lab, we said we’d describe our observations about whether to use Constant Model or Linear Model (both trained with MSE). Here are some thoughts: Recall that $r$ is the correlation coefficient, where values closer to -1 or 1 imply a very linear relationship: # you computed this in Q5a r np.float64(0.6757341092113641)\rThe relationship between $x$ and $y$ is somewhat linear; you can see this more clearly through the scatter plot, where there are many points that don’t fall close to the linear model line. With this in mind: The linear model seems to work well for most bills. However, as bills get bigger, some datapoints seem to suggest that the constant model works better. In the wild, a tip predictor may use a combination of both the constant and linear models we trained: an average prediction, or a random coin flip to pick the model, or some heuristic decision to choose one model if the total bill exceeds a certain threshold. （集成学习思想？） In the not-so-distant future of this class, you will learn more quantitative metrics to compare model performance. You will have an opportunity to explore your own models in a future assignment! Our Observations on Differences Between MAE vs. MSE Earlier in this lab, we said we’d describe our observations about the differences between the MAE and MSE. There are three key differences that we identified between the plots of the MSE and MAE. The minimizing $\\theta = \\hat{\\theta}$ is different. The plot for MAE increases linearly instead of quadratically as we move far away from the minimizing $\\theta$. The plot for MAE is piecewise linear instead of smooth. Each change in slope happens at the same $\\theta$ value as a data point in our dataset.

Your task will be to interpret the model’s performance using the two visualizations and one performance metric we’ve implemented below. First, we run sns.lmplot, which will both provide a scatterplot of mpg vs horsepower and display the least-squares line of best fit. (If you’d like to verify the OLS fit you found above is the same line found through Seaborn, change include_OLS to True.) include_OLS = True # change this flag to visualize OLS fit sns.lmplot(x='horsepower', y='mpg', data=vehicle_data); predicted_mpg_hp_only = linear_model(analytical_thetas, X) if include_OLS: # if flag is on, add OLS fit as a dotted red line plt.plot(vehicle_data['horsepower'], predicted_mpg_hp_only, 'r--') Next, we plot the residuals. While in Simple Linear Regression we have the option to plot residuals vs. the single input feature, in Multiple Linear Regression we often plot residuals vs fitted values $\\hat{\\mathbb{Y}}$. In this lab, we opt for the latter. plt.scatter(predicted_mpg_hp_only, Y - predicted_mpg_hp_only) plt.axhline(0, c='black', linewidth=1) plt.xlabel(r'Fitted Values $\\hat{\\mathbb{Y}}$') plt.ylabel(r'Residuals $\\mathbb{Y} - \\hat{\\mathbb{Y}}$'); Finally, we compute the Multiple $R^2$ metric. As described in Lecture 11 (link), $$R^2 = \\frac{\\text{variance of fitted values}}{\\text{variance of true } y} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\hat{y}}^2}{\\sigma_y^2}$$ $R^2$ can be used in the multiple regression setting, whereas $r$ (the correlation coefficient) is restricted to SLR since it depends on a single input feature.

Because it is application-specific, sklearn is often faster and more robust than the analytical/scipy-based computation methods we’ve used thus far. To use sklearn: Create an sklearn object fit the object to data Analyze fit or call predict. 1. Create object. We first create a LinearRegression object. Here’s the sklearn documentation. Note that by default, the object will include an intercept term when fitting. Here, model is like a “blank slate” for a linear model. # 1. just run this cell from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression model = LinearRegression(fit_intercept=True) 2. fit the object to data. Now, we need to tell model to “fit” itself to the data. Essentially, this is doing exactly what you did in the previous part of this lab (creating a risk function and finding the parameters that minimize that risk). Note: X needs to be a matrix (or DataFrame), as opposed to a single array (or Series). This is because sklearn.linear_model is robust enough to be used for multiple regression, which we will look at later this lab. # 2. run this cell to add sqrt(hp) column for each car in the dataset vehicle_data['sqrt(hp)'] = np.sqrt(vehicle_data['horsepower']) vehicle_data.head() mpg\rcylinders\rdisplacement\rhorsepower\rweight\racceleration\rmodel_year\rorigin\rname\rsqrt(hp)\r102\r26.0\r4\r97.0\r46.0\r1950\r21.0\r73\reurope\rvolkswagen super beetle\r6.782330\r19\r26.0\r4\r97.0\r46.0\r1835\r20.5\r70\reurope\rvolkswagen 1131 deluxe sedan\r6.782330\r325\r44.3\r4\r90.0\r48.0\r2085\r21.7\r80\reurope\rvw rabbit c (diesel)\r6.928203\r326\r43.4\r4\r90.0\r48.0\r2335\r23.7\r80\reurope\rvw dasher (diesel)\r6.928203\r244\r43.1\r4\r90.0\r48.0\r1985\r21.5\r78\reurope\rvolkswagen rabbit custom diesel\r6.928203\r# 2. run this cell model.fit(X = vehicle_data[['sqrt(hp)']], y= vehicle_data['mpg']) 3.

Below, we find the estimated mpg for a single datapoint with a sqrt(hp) of 6.78 (i.e., horsepower 46).

Multiple linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two or more explanatory variables and a response variable by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.

In matplotlib, plotting occurs on a set of Axes which are associated with a Figure. An analogy is that on a blank canvas (Figure), you choose a location to plot (Axes) and then fill it in (plot). There are two approaches to labeling and manipulating figure contents, which we’ll discuss below. Approach 1 is closest to the plotting paradigm of MATLAB, the namesake of matplotlib; Approach 2 is also common because many matplotlib-based packages (such as Seaborn) explicitly return the current set of axes after plotting data. Both are essentially equivalent, and at the end of this class you’ll be comfortable with both. Approach 1: matplotlib (or Seaborn) will auto-plot onto the current set of Axes or (if none exists) create a new figure/set of default axes. You can plot data using methods from plt, which is shorthand for the matplotlib.pyplot package. Then subsequent plt calls all edit the same set of default-created axes. Approach 2: After creating the initial plot, you can also use plt.gca() to explicitly get the current set of axes, and then edit those specific axes using axes methods. Note the method naming is slightly different! As an example of the built-in plotting functionality of pandas, the following example uses plot method of the Series class to generate a barh plot type to visually display the value counts for CVLEGEND. There are also many other plots that we will explore throughout the lab. Side note: Pandas also offers basic functionality for plotting. For example, the DataFrame and Series classes both have a plot method, which uses matplotlib under the hood. For now we’ll focus on matplotlib itself so you get used to the syntax, but just know that convenient Pandas plotting methods exist for your own future data science exploration. Below, we show both approaches by generating a horizontal bar plot to visually display the value counts for CVLEGEND. See the barhdocumentation for more details. # DEMO CELL: assign demo to 1 or 2. demo = 1 calls_cvlegend = calls['CVLEGEND'].value_counts() if demo == 1: plt.barh(calls_cvlegend.index, calls_cvlegend) # creates figure and axes (y,x) not (x,y)! print(f\"Demo {demo}: Using plt methods to update plot\") plt.ylabel(\"Crime Category\") # uses most recently plotted axes plt.xlabel(\"Number of Calls\") plt.title(\"Number of Calls by Crime Type\") elif demo == 2: print(f\"Demo {demo}: Using axes methods to update plot\") plt.barh(calls_cvlegend.index, calls_cvlegend) # creates figure and axes ax = plt.gca() ax.set_ylabel(\"Crime Category\") ax.set_xlabel(\"Number of Calls\") ax.set_title(\"Axes methods: Number of Calls by Crime Type\") else: print(\"Error: Please assign the demo variable to 1 or 2.\") plt.show() Demo 1: Using plt methods to update plot\r","date":"2024-08-13","objectID":"/datalab3/:2:1","tags":["Pandas","Seaborn","Matplotlib"],"title":"DATA100-lab3: Data Cleaning and EDA","uri":"/datalab3/"},{"categories":["DATA100"],"content":"An Additional Note on Plotting in Jupyter Notebooks You may have noticed that many of our plotting code cells end with a semicolon ; or plt.show().

In the cell below, we explore overlaying a rug plot on top of a histogram using rugplot. Note that the rug plot is hard to see. sns.histplot(x=\"inc\", data = df) sns.rugplot(x=\"inc\", data = df) plt.xlabel('Gross national income per capita, Atlas method: $: 2016') plt.title('World Bank Gross National Income Per Capita') Text(0.5, 1.0, 'World Bank Gross National Income Per Capita')\rOne way to make it easier to see the difference between the rug plot and the bars is to set a different color, for example: sns.histplot(x=\"inc\", data = df, color = \"lightsteelblue\") sns.rugplot(x=\"inc\", data = df) plt.xlabel('Gross national income per capita, Atlas method: $: 2016') plt.title('World Bank Gross National Income Per Capita') Text(0.5, 1.0, 'World Bank Gross National Income Per Capita')\rThere is also another function called kdeplot which plots a Kernel Density Estimate as described in class, and covered in more detail later in this lab. Rather than manually calling histplot, rugplot, and kdeplot to plot histograms, rug plots, and KDE plots, respectively, we can instead use displot, which can simultaneously plot histogram bars, a rug plot, and a KDE plot, and adjust all the colors automatically for visbility. Using the documentation for displot (Link), make a plot of the income data that includes a histogram, rug plot, and KDE plot. Hint: You’ll need to set two parameters to True. sns.displot(x='inc', data=df, kde=True, rug=True) plt.xlabel('Gross national income per capita, Atlas method: $: 2016') # 太长了，显示不全 plt.title('World Bank Gross National Income Per Capita') Text(0.5, 1.0, 'World Bank Gross National Income Per Capita')\rYou should see roughly the same histogram as before. However, now you should see an overlaid smooth line. This is the kernel density estimate discussed in class. Above, the y-axis is labeled by the counts. We can also label the y-axis by the density. An example is given below, this time using the literacy data from the beginning of this lab. sns.displot(x=\"lit\", data = df, rug = True, kde = True, stat = \"density\") plt.xlabel(\"Adult literacy rate: Combined: % ages 15 and older: 2005-14\") plt.title('World Bank Combined Adult Literacy Rate') Text(0.5, 1.0, 'World Bank Combined Adult Literacy Rate')\rObservations: You’ll also see that the y-axis value is no longer the count. Instead it is a value such that the total area in the histogram is 1. For example, the area of the last bar is approximately 22.22 * 0.028 = 0.62 The KDE is a smooth estimate of the distribution of the given variable. The area under the KDE is also 1. While it is not obvious from the figure, some of the area under the KDE is beyond the 100% literacy. In other words, the KDE is non-zero for values greater than 100%. This, of course, makes no physical sense. Nonetheless, it is a mathematical feature of the KDE. We’ll talk more about KDEs later in this lab.

The KDE also has a problem where the density function has a lot of area below 0. Transforming the inc data logarithmically gives us a more symmetric distribution of values. This can make it easier to see patterns. In addition, summary statistics like the mean and standard deviation (square-root of the variance) are more stable with symmetric distributions. In the cell below, make a distribution plot of inc with the data transformed using np.log10 and kde=True. If you want to see the exact counts, just set kde=False. If you don’t specify the kde parameter, it is by default set to True. Hint: Unlike the examples above, you can pass a series to the displot function, i.e. rather than passing an entire DataFrame as data and a column as x, you can instead pass a series. ax = sns.displot(data=np.log10(df['inc']), kde=True, color='blue') plt.title('World Bank Gross National Income Per Capita') plt.ylabel('Density') plt.xlabel('Log Gross national income per capita, Atlas method: $: 2016'); When a distribution has a long right tail, a log-transformation often does a good job of symmetrizing the distribution, as it did here. Long right tails are common with variables that have a lower limit on the values. On the other hand, long left tails are common with distributions of variables that have an upper limit, such as percentages (can’t be higher than 100%) and GPAs (can’t be higher than 4). That is the case for the literacy rate. Typically taking a power-transformation such as squaring or cubing the values can help symmetrize the left skew distribution. In the cell below, we will make a distribution plot of lit with the data transformed using a power, i.e., raise lit to the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th power.

Part 2: Kernel Density Estimation In this part of the lab you will develop a deeper understanding of how kernel density estimation works. Explain KDE briefly within the lab ","date":"2024-08-13","objectID":"/datalab4/:6:0","tags":["Seaborn","Plotly"],"title":"DATA100-lab4: Visualization, Transformations, and KDEs","uri":"/datalab4/"},{"categories":["DATA100"],"content":"Overview Kernel density estimation is used to estimate a probability density function (i.e. a density curve) from a set of data. Just like a histogram, a density function’s total area must sum to 1. KDE centrally revolves around this idea of a “kernel”. A kernel is a function whose area sums to 1. The three steps involved in building a kernel density estimate are: Placing a kernel at each observation Normalizing kernels so that the sum of their areas is 1 Summing all kernels together 😋 The end result is a function, that takes in some value x and returns a density estimate at the point x. When constructing a KDE, there are several choices to make regarding the kernel. Specifically, we need to choose the function we want to use as our kernel, as well as a bandwidth parameter, which tells us how wide or narrow each kernel should be. We will explore these ideas now. Suppose we have 3 data points with values 2, 4, and 9. We can compute the (useless) histogram with a KDE as shown below. data3pts = np.array([2, 4, 9]) sns.displot(data3pts, kde = True, stat = \"density\"); To understand how KDEs are computed, we need to see the KDE outside the given range. The easiest way to do this is to use an old function called distplot. During the Spring 2022 offering of this course, distplot was still a working function in Seaborn, but it will be removed at a future date. If you get an error that says that distplot is not a valid function, sorry, you are too far in the future to do this lab exercise. sns.distplot(data3pts, kde = True); C:\\Users\\86135\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ipykernel_9696\\4279347623.py:1: UserWarning: `distplot` is a deprecated function and will be removed in seaborn v0.14.0.\rPlease adapt your code to use either `displot` (a figure-level function with\rsimilar flexibility) or `histplot` (an axes-level function for histograms).\rFor a guide to updating your code to use the new functions, please see\rhttps://gist.github.com/mwaskom/de44147ed2974457ad6372750bbe5751\rsns.distplot(data3pts, kde = True);\r调整bandwidth One question you might be wondering is how the kernel density estimator decides how “wide” each point should be. It turns out this is a parameter you can set called bw, which stands for bandwith. For example, the code below gives a bandwith value of 0.5 to each data point. You’ll see the resulting KDE is quite different. Try experimenting with different values of bandwidth and see what happens. sns.distplot(data3pts, kde = True, kde_kws = {\"bw\": 0.5}); C:\\Users\\86135\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ipykernel_9696\\942060009.py:1: UserWarning: `distplot` is a deprecated function and will be removed in seaborn v0.14.0.\rPlease adapt your code to use either `displot` (a figure-level function with\rsimilar flexibility) or `histplot` (an axes-level function for histograms).\rFor a guide to updating your code to use the new functions, please see\rhttps://gist.github.com/mwaskom/de44147ed2974457ad6372750bbe5751\rsns.distplot(data3pts, kde = True, kde_kws = {\"bw\": 0.5});\rd:\\miniconda3\\envs\\ds100\\Lib\\site-packages\\seaborn\\distributions.py:2496: UserWarning: The `bw` parameter is deprecated in favor of `bw_method` and `bw_adjust`.\rSetting `bw_method=0.5`, but please see the docs for the new parameters\rand update your code.

The default kernel used by the distplot function (as well as kdeplot) is the Gaussian kernel, given by: $$\\Large K_\\alpha(x, z) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi \\alpha^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x - z)^2}{2 \\alpha ^2} \\right) $$ We’ve implemented the Gaussian kernel for you in Python below. Here, alpha is the smoothing or bandwidth parameter $\\alpha$ for the KDE, z is the center of the Gaussian (i.e. a data point or an array of data points), and x is an array of values of the variable whose distribution we are plotting. def gaussian_kernel(alpha, x, z): return 1.0/np.sqrt(2. * np.pi * alpha**2) * np.exp(-(x - z) ** 2 / (2.0 * alpha**2)) For example, we can plot the Gaussian kernel centered at 9 with $\\alpha$ = 0.5 as below: xs = np.linspace(-2, 12, 200) alpha=0.5 kde_curve = [gaussian_kernel(alpha, x, 9) for x in xs] plt.plot(xs, kde_curve); In the cell below, plot the 3 kernel density functions corresponding to our 3 data points on the same axis. Use an alpha value of 0.5. Recall that our three data points are 2, 4, and 9. Note: Make sure to normalize your kernels! This means that the area under each of your kernels should be $\\frac{1}{3}$ since there are three data points. You don’t have to use the following hints, but they might be helpful in simplifying your code. Hint: The gaussian_kernel function can also take a numpy array as an argument for z. Hint: To plot multiple plots at once, you can use plt.plot(xs, y) with a two dimensional array as y. xs = np.linspace(-2, 12, 200) alpha=0.5 kde_curve = [1/3*gaussian_kernel(alpha, x, data3pts) for x in xs] # 注意“正则化”！ plt.plot(xs, kde_curve); In the cell below, we see a plot that shows the sum of all three of the kernels above. The plot resembles the kde shown when you called distplot function with bandwidth 0.5 earlier. The area under the final curve will be 1 since the area under each of the three normalized kernels is $\\frac{1}{3}$. xs = np.linspace(-2, 12, 200) alpha=0.5 kde_curve = np.array([1/3 * gaussian_kernel(alpha, x, data3pts) for x in xs]) plt.plot(xs, np.sum(kde_curve, axis = 1)); # 叠加曲线!

Recall that this is Josh’s preferred plotting library, though it is not officially covered nor required in this class. This is purely for your future reference if you decide to use plotly on your own. import plotly.express as px px.histogram(df, x = \"lit\") In my opinion, distribution plots are the one place where plotly falls short of seaborn. For example, if we want a rug, KDE, and histogram, the code below does this in plotly. I’m not personally a fan. import plotly.figure_factory as ff ff.create_distplot([df[\"lit\"]], [\"lit\"]) By contrast, I think many of plotly’s other features are far superior to seaborn. For example, consider the interactive scatterplot below, where one can mouseover each datapoint in order to see the identity of each country. px.scatter(df, x = \"lit\", y = \"inc\", hover_name = df.index, labels={ \"lit\": \"Adult literacy rate: Combined: % ages 15 and older\", \"inc\": \"Gross national income per capita\" }, title=\"World Bank: Gross National Income Per Capita vs\\n Combined Adult Literacy Rate\" ) Naturally there are ways to adjust figure size, text size, marker, etc, but they are not covered here.

otter.Notebook(\"lab02.ipynb\") Pandas is one of the most widely used Python libraries in data science. In this lab, you will review commonly used data wrangling operations/tools in Pandas. We aim to give you familiarity with: Creating DataFrames Slicing DataFrames (i.e. selecting rows and columns) Filtering data (using boolean arrays and groupby.filter) Aggregating (using groupby.agg) In this lab you are going to use several pandas methods. Reminder from lecture that you may press shift+tab on method parameters to see the documentation for that method. For example, if you were using the drop method in pandas, you couold press shift+tab to see what drop is expecting. Pandas is very similar to the datascience library that you saw in Data 8. This conversion notebook may serve as a useful guide! This lab expects that you have watched the pandas lectures. If you have not, this lab will probably take a very long time. Note: The Pandas interface is notoriously confusing for beginners, and the documentation is not consistently great. Throughout the semester, you will have to search through Pandas documentation and experiment, but remember it is part of the learning experience and will help shape you as a data scientist! import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import pandas as pd import plotly.express as px %matplotlib inline ","date":"2024-07-15","objectID":"/datalab2/:0:0","tags":["Pandas"],"title":"DATA100-lab2","uri":"/datalab2/"},{"categories":["DATA100"],"content":"Creating DataFrames \u0026 Basic Manipulations Recall that a DataFrame is a table in which each column has a specific data type; there is an index over the columns (typically string labels) and an index over the rows (typically ordinal numbers). Usually you’ll create DataFrames by using a function like pd.read_csv. However, in this section, we’ll discuss how to create them from scratch. The documentation for the pandas DataFrame class provides several constructors for the DataFrame class. Syntax 1: You can create a DataFrame by specifying the columns and values using a dictionary as shown below. The keys of the dictionary are the column names, and the values of the dictionary are lists containing the row entries. fruit_info = pd.DataFrame( data = {'fruit': ['apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'raspberry'], 'color': ['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'pink'], 'price': [1.0, 0.75, 0.35, 0.05] }) fruit_info fruit\rcolor\rprice\r0\rapple\rred\r1.00\r1\rorange\rorange\r0.75\r2\rbanana\ryellow\r0.35\r3\rraspberry\rpink\r0.05\rSyntax 2: You can also define a DataFrame by specifying the rows as shown below. Each row corresponds to a distinct tuple, and the columns are specified separately. 这里可以看出columns是个参数 fruit_info2 = pd.DataFrame( [(\"red\", \"apple\", 1.0), (\"orange\", \"orange\", 0.75), (\"yellow\", \"banana\", 0.35), (\"pink\", \"raspberry\", 0.05)], columns = [\"color\", \"fruit\", \"price\"]) fruit_info2 color\rfruit\rprice\r0\rred\rapple\r1.00\r1\rorange\rorange\r0.75\r2\ryellow\rbanana\r0.35\r3\rpink\rraspberry\r0.05\rYou can obtain the dimensions of a DataFrame by using the shape attribute DataFrame.shape. fruit_info.shape (4, 3)\rYou can also convert the entire DataFrame into a two-dimensional NumPy array. fruit_info.values array([['apple', 'red', 1.0],\r['orange', 'orange', 0.75],\r['banana', 'yellow', 0.35],\r['raspberry', 'pink', 0.05]], dtype=object)\rThere are other constructors but we do not discuss them here.

Let’s review them briefly. Approach 1: loc The first of the two verbose operators is loc, which takes two arguments. The first is one or more row labels, the second is one or more column labels. The desired rows or columns can be provided individually, in slice notation, or as a list. Some examples are given below. Note that slicing in loc is inclusive on the provided labels. #get rows 0 through 2 and columns fruit through price fruit_info.loc[0:2, 'fruit':'price'] # 闭区间 fruit\rcolor\rprice\r0\rapple\rred\r1.00\r1\rorange\rorange\r0.75\r2\rbanana\ryellow\r0.35\r# get rows 0 through 2 and columns fruit and price. # Note the difference in notation and result from the previous example. fruit_info.loc[0:2, ['fruit', 'price']] # 离散 fruit\rprice\r0\rapple\r1.00\r1\rorange\r0.75\r2\rbanana\r0.35\r# get rows 0 and 2 and columns fruit and price. fruit_info.loc[[0, 2], ['fruit', 'price']] # 更加离散 fruit\rprice\r0\rapple\r1.00\r2\rbanana\r0.35\r# get rows 0 and 2 and column fruit fruit_info.loc[[0, 2], ['fruit']] fruit\r0\rapple\r2\rbanana\rNote that if we request a single column but don’t enclose it in a list, the return type of the loc operator is a Series rather than a DataFrame. 注意[ ]包裹问题 # get rows 0 and 2 and column fruit, returning the result as a Series fruit_info.loc[[0, 2], 'fruit'] 0 apple\r2 banana\rName: fruit, dtype: object\rIf we provide only one argument to loc, it uses the provided argument to select rows, and returns all columns.可以只给行， 不可以只给列 fruit_info.loc[0:1] fruit\rcolor\rprice\r0\rapple\rred\r1.00\r1\rorange\rorange\r0.75\rNote that if you try to access columns without providing rows, loc will crash. # uncomment, this code will crash # fruit_info.loc[[\"fruit\", \"price\"]] # uncomment, this code works fine: fruit_info.loc[:, [\"fruit\", \"price\"]] fruit\rprice\r0\rapple\r1.00\r1\rorange\r0.75\r2\rbanana\r0.35\r3\rraspberry\r0.05\rApproach 2: iloc iloc is very similar to loc except that its arguments are row numbers and column numbers, rather than row labels and labels names. A usueful mnemonic is that the i stands for “integer”. In addition, slicing for iloc is exclusive on the provided integer indices. Some examples are given below: 考虑此时变成python经典索引 # get rows 0 through 3 (exclusive) and columns 0 through 2 (exclusive) fruit_info.iloc[0:3, 0:3] fruit\rcolor\rprice\r0\rapple\rred\r1.00\r1\rorange\rorange\r0.75\r2\rbanana\ryellow\r0.35\r# get rows 0 through 3 (exclusive) and columns 0 and 2. fruit_info.iloc[0:3, [0, 2]] fruit\rprice\r0\rapple\r1.00\r1\rorange\r0.75\r2\rbanana\r0.35\r# get rows 0 and 2 and columns 0 and 2. fruit_info.iloc[[0, 2], [0, 2]] fruit\rprice\r0\rapple\r1.00\r2\rbanana\r0.35\r#get rows 0 and 2 and column fruit fruit_info.iloc[[0, 2], [0]] fruit\r0\rapple\r2\rbanana\r# get rows 0 and 2 and column fruit fruit_info.iloc[[0, 2], 0] # return a Series! 0 apple\r2 banana\rName: fruit, dtype: object\rNote that in these loc and iloc examples above, the row label and row number were always the same. Let’s see an example where they are different. If we sort our fruits by price, we get: fruit_info_sorted = fruit_info.sort_values(\"price\") fruit_info_sorted fruit\rcolor\rprice\r3\rraspberry\rpink\r0.05\r2\rbanana\ryellow\r0.35\r1\rorange\rorange\r0.75\r0\rapple\rred\r1.00\rObserve that the row number 0 now has index 3, row number 1 now has index 2, etc. These indices are the arbitrary numerical index generated when we created the DataFrame. For example, banana was originally in row 2, and so it has row label 2. If we request the rows in positions 0 and 2 using iloc, we’re indexing using the row NUMBERS, not labels. 这里似乎并不是按照lab所说的那样? fruit_info_sorted.iloc[[0, 2], 0] # 别和数学表达混淆! 3 raspberry\r1 orange\rName: fruit, dtype: object\rLastly, similar to with loc, the second argument to iloc is optional. That is, if you provide only one argument to iloc, it treats the argument you provide as a set of desired row numbers, not column numbers. 可以只给行，不可给列 fruit_info.iloc[[0, 2]] fruit\rcolor\rpr","date":"2024-07-15","objectID":"/datalab2/:1:1","tags":["Pandas"],"title":"DATA100-lab2","uri":"/datalab2/"},{"categories":["DATA100"],"content":"Question 1(a) For a DataFrame d, you can add a column with d['new column name'] = ... and assign a list or array of values to the column.

We’ll be using the babynames dataset from Lecture 1. The babynames dataset contains a record of the given names of babies born in the United States each year. First let’s run the following cells to build the DataFrame baby_names. The cells below download the data from the web and extract the data into a DataFrame. There should be a total of 6215834 records.

The pathlib module is effective for writing code that works on different operating systems and filesystems. To check if a file exists at a path, use .exists(). To create a directory for a path, use .mkdir(). To remove a file that might be a symbolic link, use .unlink(). This function creates a path to a directory that will contain data files. It ensures that the directory exists (which is required to write files in that directory), then proceeds to download the file based on its URL. The benefit of this function is that not only can you force when you want a new file to be downloaded using the force parameter, but in cases when you don’t need the file to be re-downloaded, you can use the cached version and save download time. Below we use fetch_and_cache to download the namesbystate.zip zip file, which is a compressed directory of CSV files. This might take a little while! Consider stretching. data_url = 'https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/state/namesbystate.zip' namesbystate_path = fetch_and_cache(data_url, 'namesbystate.zip') Using cached version downloaded at Fri Jul 12 20:04:41 2024\rThe following cell builds the final full baby_names DataFrame.

Exercise: Using filter, create a DataFrame major_party_results_since_1988 that includes all election results starting in 1988, but only show a row if the Party it belongs to has earned at least 1% of the popular vote in ANY election since 1988. For example, in 1988, you should not include the New Alliance candidate, since this party has not earned 1% of the vote since 1988. However, you should include the Libertarian candidate from 1988 despite only having 0.47 percent of the vote in 1988, because in 2016 and 2020, the Libertarian candidates Gary Johnson and Jo Jorgensen exceeded 1% of the vote.

What real-world events in the U.S. occurred when there was a steep drop in babies named Hillary? hillary_baby_name = baby_names[(baby_names['Name'] == 'Hillary') \u0026 (baby_names['State'] == 'CA') \u0026 (baby_names['Sex'] == 'F')] plt.plot(hillary_baby_name['Year'], hillary_baby_name['Count']) plt.title(\"Hillary Popularity Over Time\") plt.xlabel('Year') plt.ylabel('Count'); The code above is hard coded to generate a dataframe representing the popularity of the female name Hillary in the state of California. While this approach works, it’s inelegant. Here we’ll use a more elegant approach that builds a dataframe such that: It contains ALL names. The counts are summed across all 50 states, not just California. To do this, we use groupby, though here we’re grouping on two columns (“Name” and “Year”) instead of just one. After grouping, we use the sum aggregation function. # just run this cell counts_aggregated_by_name_and_year = baby_names.groupby([\"Name\", \"Year\"]).sum() counts_aggregated_by_name_and_year Note that the resulting DataFrame is multi-indexed, i.e. it has two indices. The outer index is the Name, and the inner index is the Year. In order to visualize this data, we’ll use reset_index in order to set the index back to an integer and transform the Name and Year back into columnar data. # just run this cell counts_aggregated_by_name_and_year = counts_aggregated_by_name_and_year.reset_index() counts_aggregated_by_name_and_year Similar to before, we can plot the popularity of a given name by selecting the name we want to visualize. The code below is very similar to the plotting code above, except that we use query to get the name of interest instead of using a boolean array. Note: Here we use a special syntax @name_of_interest to tell the query command to use the python variable name_of_interest. Try out some other names and see what trends you observe. Note that since this is the American social security database, international names are not well represented. # just run this cell name_of_interest = 'Hillary' chosen_baby_name = counts_aggregated_by_name_and_year.query(\"Name == @name_of_interest\") plt.plot(chosen_baby_name['Year'], chosen_baby_name['Count']) plt.title(f\"Popularity Of {name_of_interest} Over Time\") plt.xlabel('Year') plt.ylabel('Count'); To double-check your work, the cell below will rerun all of the autograder tests. grader.check_all() ","date":"2024-07-15","objectID":"/datalab2/:4:1","tags":["Pandas"],"title":"DATA100-lab2","uri":"/datalab2/"},{"categories":["DATA100"],"content":"Submission Make sure you have run all cells in your notebook in order before running the cell below, so that all images/graphs appear in the output.

For integer arguments the function is roughly equivalent to the Python built-in :py:class:`range`, but returns an ndarray rather than a ``range`` instance. When using a non-integer step, such as 0.1, it is often better to use `numpy.linspace`. See the Warning sections below for more information. Parameters ---------- start : integer or real, optional Start of interval. The interval includes this value. The default start value is 0. stop : integer or real End of interval. The interval does not include this value, except in some cases where `step` is not an integer and floating point round-off affects the length of `out`. step : integer or real, optional Spacing between values. For any output `out`, this is the distance between two adjacent values, ``out[i+1] - out[i]``. The default step size is 1. If `step` is specified as a position argument, `start` must also be given. dtype : dtype, optional The type of the output array. If `dtype` is not given, infer the data type from the other input arguments. device : str, optional The device on which to place the created array. Default: None. For Array-API interoperability only, so must be ``\"cpu\"`` if passed. .. versionadded:: 2.0.0 like : array_like, optional Reference object to allow the creation of arrays which are not NumPy arrays. If an array-like passed in as ``like`` supports the ``__array_function__`` protocol, the result will be defined by it. In this case, it ensures the creation of an array object compatible with that passed in via this argument. .. versionadded:: 1.20.0 Returns ------- arange : ndarray Array of evenly spaced values. For floating point arguments, the length of the result is ``ceil((stop - start)/step)``. Because of floating point overflow, this rule may result in the last element of `out` being greater than `stop`. Warnings -------- The length of the output might not be numerically stable. Another stability issue is due to the internal implementation of `numpy.arange`. The actual step value used to populate the array is ``dtype(start + step) - dtype(start)`` and not `step`. Precision loss can occur here, due to casting or due to using floating points when `start` is much larger than `step`. This can lead to unexpected behaviour. For example:: \u003e\u003e\u003e np.arange(0, 5, 0.5, dtype=int) array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]) \u003e\u003e\u003e np.arange(-3, 3, 0.5, dtype=int) array([-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]) In such cases, the use of `numpy.linspace` should be preferred. The built-in :py:class:`range` generates :std:doc:`Python built-in integers that have arbitrary size \u003cpython:c-api/long\u003e`, while `numpy.arange` produces `numpy.int32` or `numpy.int64` numbers. This may result in incorrect results for large integer values:: \u003e\u003e\u003e power = 40 \u003e\u003e\u003e modulo = 10000 \u003e\u003e\u003e x1 = [(n ** power) % modulo for n in range(8)] \u003e\u003e\u003e x2 = [(n ** power) % modulo for n in np.arange(8)] \u003e\u003e\u003e print(x1) [0, 1, 7776, 8801, 6176, 625, 6576, 4001] # correct \u003e\u003e\u003e print(x2) [0, 1, 7776, 7185, 0, 5969, 4816, 3361] # incorrect See Also -------- numpy","date":"2024-07-14","objectID":"/datahw01/:5:3","tags":["math","plotting"],"title":"DATA100-hw01","uri":"/datahw01/"},{"categories":["DATA100"],"content":"Preliminary: LaTeX You should use LaTeX to format math in your answers.

In Data 8 you visualized numerical distributions by drawing histograms, which look like bar charts but represent proportions by the areas of the bars instead of the heights or lengths. In this exercise you will use the hist function in matplotlib instead of the corresponding Table method to draw histograms. To start off, suppose we want to plot the probability distribution of the number of spots on a single roll of a die. That should be a flat histogram since the chance of each of the values 1 through 6 is 1/6. Here is a first attempt at drawing the histogram. faces = range(1, 7) plt.hist(faces) (array([1., 0., 1., 0., 1., 0., 1., 0., 1., 1.]), array([1. , 1.5, 2. , 2.5, 3. , 3.5, 4. , 4.5, 5. , 5.5, 6. ]), \u003cBarContainer object of 10 artists\u003e) This default plot is not helpful. We have to choose some arguments to get a visualization that we can interpret. Note that the second printed line shows the left ends of the default bins, as well as the right end of the last bin. The first line shows the counts in the bins. If you don’t want the printed lines you can add a semi-colon at the end of the call to plt.hist, but we’ll keep the lines for now. Let’s redraw the histogram with bins of unit length centered at the possible values. By the end of the exercise you’ll see a reason for centering. Notice that the argument for specifying bins is the same as the one for the Table method hist. unit_bins = np.arange(0.5, 6.6) plt.hist(faces, bins = unit_bins) (array([1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1.]), array([0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5]), \u003cBarContainer object of 6 artists\u003e) We need to see the edges of the bars! Let’s specify the edge color ec to be white. Here are all the colors you could use, but do try to drag yourself away from the poetic names. plt.hist(faces, bins = unit_bins, ec='white') (array([1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1.]), array([0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5]), \u003cBarContainer object of 6 artists\u003e) That’s much better, but look at the vertical axis. It is not drawn to the density scale defined in Data 8. We want a histogram of a probability distribution, so the total area should be 1. We just have to ask for that. plt.hist(faces, bins = unit_bins, ec='white', density=True) (array([0.16666667, 0.16666667, 0.16666667, 0.16666667, 0.16666667, 0.16666667]), array([0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5]), \u003cBarContainer object of 6 artists\u003e) That’s the probability histogram of the number of spots on one roll of a die. The proportion is $1/6$ in each of the bins. Note: You may notice that running the above cells also displayed the return value of the last function call of each cell. This was intentional on our part to show you how plt.hist() (documentation) returned different values per plot.

That being said, Lecture 2 provides additional historical context and definitions for probability sample, sampling bias, and chance error). One way to use probability samples is to quantify sampling bias and chance error. Put briefly, if we assume that a sample distribution was selected at random from a known population, then we can quantify how likely that sample is to have arisen due to random chance (chance error). If the difference in sample and population distributions is too great, then we suspect that the given sample has bias in how it was selected from the population. Let’s see this process in a post-analysis of pre-election polling of the 1936 U.S. Presidential Election. Through the U.S. electoral college process (we’ll ignore it in this question, but read more here), Franklin D. Roosevelt won the election by an overwhelming margin. The popular vote results were approximately 61% Roosevelt (Democrat, incumbent), 37% Alf Landon (Republican), and 2% other candidates. For this problem, this is our population distribution. You can use np.random.multinomial to simulate drawing at random with replacement from a categorical distribution. The arguments are the sample size n and an array pvals of the proportions in all the categories. The function simulates n independent random draws from the distribution and returns the observed counts in all the categories. Read the documentation to see how this is described formally; we will use the formal terminology and notation in future assignments after we have discussed them in class. You will see that the function also takes a third argument size, which for our purposes will be an integer that specifies the number of times to run the entire simulation. All the runs are independent of each other. Write one line of code that uses np.random.multinomial to run 10 independent simulations of drawing 100 times at random with replacement from a population in which 61% of the people vote for Roosevelt, 37% for Landon, and 2% for other candidatdes. The output should be an array containing the counts in the Roosevelt category in the 10 simulations. It will help to recall how to slice NumPy arrays.

Note: In this course we often opt for $x$ instead of $\\vec{x}$ to simplify notation; $x$ as a vector is inferred from its use in the dot product. Then $x_i$ is the $i$-th element of the vector $x$. Detail: In this course, we prefer the notation $x^Ty$ to illustrate a dot product, defined as matrix multiplication of $x^T$ and $y$. In the literature you may also see $x \\cdot y$, but we avoid this notation since the dot ($\\cdot$) notation is occasionally used for scalar values. Detail: The dot product is a special case of an inner product, where $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. (2) We introduce a special vector, $\\mathbb{1}$, to write the mean $\\bar{x}$ of data $(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n)$ as a dot product: \\begin{align} \\bar{x} \u0026= \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n 1x_i \\ \u0026= \\frac{1}{n}(x^T\\mathbb{1}). \\end{align} The data $(x_1, \\dots, x_n)$ have been defined as an $n$-dimensional column vector $x$, where $x = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \\dots \\ x_n \\end{bmatrix}$. The special vector $\\mathbb{1}$ is a vector of ones, whose length is defined by the vector operation in which it is used. So with $n$-dimensional column vector $x$, the dot product $x^T\\mathbb{1}$ implies that $\\mathbb{1}$ is an $n$-dimensional column vector where every element is $1$. Because dot products produce scalars, the multiplication of two scalars $\\frac{1}{n}$ and $x^T\\mathbb{1}$ produces another scalar, $\\bar{x}$. Note: We use bar notation for the mean ($\\bar{x}$ instead of $\\mu$) in this problem to differentiate $\\bar{x}$ from $\\bar{y}$, the latter of which is the mean of data $(y_1, \\dots, y_n)$. (3) We can further use this definition of $\\bar{x}$ to additionally write the variance $\\sigma_x^2$ of the data $(x_1, \\dots, x_n)$ as a dot product. Verify for yourself that the below operation defines $\\sigma_x^2$ as a scalar: \\begin{align} \\sigma_x^2 \u0026= \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 \\ \u0026= \\frac{1}{n}(x - \\bar{x})^T(x - \\bar{x}). \\end{align} ","date":"2024-07-14","objectID":"/datahw01/:11:1","tags":["math","plotting"],"title":"DATA100-hw01","uri":"/datahw01/"},{"categories":["DATA100"],"content":"Question 6a To verify your understanding of the dot product as defined above, suppose you are working with $n$ datapoints ${(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \\dots, (x_n, y_n)}$.

Define $\\bar{x}$ and $\\bar{y}$ as the means of the $x$ data and $y$ data, respectively. Define $\\sigma_x^2$ and $\\sigma_y^2$ as the variances of the $x$ data and $y$ data, respectively.

At this time, it may be helpful to review the Data 8 section. Before we continue, let’s contextualize our computation by loading in a dataset you saw in Data 8: the relation between weight lifted and shot put distance among surveyed female collegiate athletes. We’ve plotted the point using matplotlib’s scatter function, which you will see in more detail in two weeks. # Run this cell to plot the data. weight_lifted = np.array([ 37.5, 51.5, 61.3, 61.3, 63.6, 66.1, 70. , 92.7, 90.5, 90.5, 94.8, 97. , 97. , 97. , 102. , 102. , 103.6, 100.4, 108.4, 114. , 115.3, 114.9, 114.7, 123.6, 125.8, 119.1, 118.9, 141.1]) shot_put_distance = np.array([ 6.4, 10.2, 12.4, 13. , 13.2, 13. , 12.7, 13.9, 15.5, 15.8, 15.8, 16.8, 17.1, 17.8, 14.8, 15.5, 16.1, 16.2, 17.9, 15.9, 15.8, 16.7, 17.6, 16.8, 17. , 18.2, 19.2, 18.6]) plt.scatter(weight_lifted, shot_put_distance) plt.xlabel(\"Weight Lifted\") plt.ylabel(\"Shot Put Distance\") Looks pretty linear! Let’s try to fit a regression line to this data. Define the vectors $x$ as the weight lifted data vector and $y$ as the shot put distance data vector, respectively, of the college athletes. Then the regression line uses the weight lifted $x$ to predict $\\hat{y}$, which is the linear estimate of the actual value shot put distance $y$ as follows: \\begin{align} \\hat{y} \u0026= \\hat{a} + \\hat{b}{x}\\text{, where} \\ \\hat{a} \u0026= \\bar{y} - \\hat{b}\\bar{x} \\ \\hat{b} \u0026= r \\dfrac{\\sigma_y}{\\sigma_x} \\end{align} $\\bar{x}, \\bar{y}$ and $\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y$ are the means and standard deviations, respectively of the data $x$ and $y$, respectively. Here, $r$ is the correlation coefficient as defined in Data 8! Note: We use the hat $\\hat{}$ notation to indicate values we are estimating: $\\hat{y}$, the predicted shot put distance, as well as $\\hat{a}$ and $\\hat{b}$, the respective estimated intercept and slope parameters we are using to model the “best” linear predictor of $y$ from $x$. We’ll dive into this later in the course. Note: Remember how we dropped the $\\vec{}$ vector notation? These linear regression equations therefore represent both the scalar case (predict a single value $\\hat{y}$ from a single $x$) and the vector case (predict a vector $\\hat{y}$ element-wise from a vector $x$).

Like Python lists, arrays store data; however, they store data in a more efficient manner. In many cases, this allows for faster computation and data manipulation. In Data 8, we used make_array from the datascience module, but that’s not the most typical way. Instead, use np.array to create an array. It takes a sequence, such as a list or range. Below, create an array arr containing the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (in that order). arr = np.array([1,2,3,4,5]) grader.check(\"q1\") q1 passed! 🌟 In addition to values in the array, we can access attributes such as shape and data type. A full list of attributes can be found here. arr[3] np.int64(4)\rarr[2:4] # 左闭右开 array([3, 4])\rarr.shape # 一维长度为5 (5,)\rarr.dtype dtype('int64')\rArrays, unlike Python lists, cannot store items of different data types. # A regular Python list can store items of different data types [1, '3'] [1, '3']\r# Arrays will convert everything to the same data type np.array([1, '3']) array(['1', '3'], dtype='\u003cU21')\r# Another example of array type conversion np.array([5, 8.3]) array([5. , 8.3])\rArrays are also useful in performing vectorized operations. Given two or more arrays of equal length, arithmetic will perform element-wise computations across the arrays. For example, observe the following: # Python list addition will concatenate the two lists [1, 2, 3] + [4, 5, 6] [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\r# NumPy array addition will add them element-wise np.array([1, 2, 3]) + np.array([4, 5, 6]) array([5, 7, 9])\r","date":"2024-07-13","objectID":"/datalab1/:2:3","tags":["Jupyter","numpy","matplotlib"],"title":"DATA100-lab1","uri":"/datalab1/"},{"categories":["DATA100"],"content":"Question 2 Question 2a Write a function summation that evaluates the following summation for $n \\geq 1$: $$\\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^3 + 3 i^2$$ Note: You should not use for loops in your solution.
