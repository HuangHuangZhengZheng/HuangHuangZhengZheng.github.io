For integer arguments the function is roughly equivalent to the Python built-in :py:class:`range`, but returns an ndarray rather than a ``range`` instance. When using a non-integer step, such as 0.1, it is often better to use `numpy.linspace`. See the Warning sections below for more information. Parameters ---------- start : integer or real, optional Start of interval. The interval includes this value. The default start value is 0. stop : integer or real End of interval. The interval does not include this value, except in some cases where `step` is not an integer and floating point round-off affects the length of `out`. step : integer or real, optional Spacing between values. For any output `out`, this is the distance between two adjacent values, ``out[i+1] - out[i]``. The default step size is 1. If `step` is specified as a position argument, `start` must also be given. dtype : dtype, optional The type of the output array. If `dtype` is not given, infer the data type from the other input arguments. device : str, optional The device on which to place the created array. Default: None. For Array-API interoperability only, so must be ``\"cpu\"`` if passed. .. versionadded:: 2.0.0 like : array_like, optional Reference object to allow the creation of arrays which are not NumPy arrays. If an array-like passed in as ``like`` supports the ``__array_function__`` protocol, the result will be defined by it. In this case, it ensures the creation of an array object compatible with that passed in via this argument. .. versionadded:: 1.20.0 Returns ------- arange : ndarray Array of evenly spaced values. For floating point arguments, the length of the result is ``ceil((stop - start)/step)``. Because of floating point overflow, this rule may result in the last element of `out` being greater than `stop`. Warnings -------- The length of the output might not be numerically stable. Another stability issue is due to the internal implementation of `numpy.arange`. The actual step value used to populate the array is ``dtype(start + step) - dtype(start)`` and not `step`. Precision loss can occur here, due to casting or due to using floating points when `start` is much larger than `step`. This can lead to unexpected behaviour. For example:: \u003e\u003e\u003e np.arange(0, 5, 0.5, dtype=int) array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]) \u003e\u003e\u003e np.arange(-3, 3, 0.5, dtype=int) array([-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]) In such cases, the use of `numpy.linspace` should be preferred. The built-in :py:class:`range` generates :std:doc:`Python built-in integers that have arbitrary size \u003cpython:c-api/long\u003e`, while `numpy.arange` produces `numpy.int32` or `numpy.int64` numbers. This may result in incorrect results for large integer values:: \u003e\u003e\u003e power = 40 \u003e\u003e\u003e modulo = 10000 \u003e\u003e\u003e x1 = [(n ** power) % modulo for n in range(8)] \u003e\u003e\u003e x2 = [(n ** power) % modulo for n in np.arange(8)] \u003e\u003e\u003e print(x1) [0, 1, 7776, 8801, 6176, 625, 6576, 4001] # correct \u003e\u003e\u003e print(x2) [0, 1, 7776, 7185, 0, 5969, 4816, 3361] # incorrect See Also -------- numpy","date":"2024-07-14","objectID":"/datahw01/:5:3","tags":["math","plotting"],"title":"DATA100-hw01","uri":"/datahw01/"},{"categories":["DATA100"],"content":"Preliminary: LaTeX You should use LaTeX to format math in your answers.

In Data 8 you visualized numerical distributions by drawing histograms, which look like bar charts but represent proportions by the areas of the bars instead of the heights or lengths. In this exercise you will use the hist function in matplotlib instead of the corresponding Table method to draw histograms. To start off, suppose we want to plot the probability distribution of the number of spots on a single roll of a die. That should be a flat histogram since the chance of each of the values 1 through 6 is 1/6. Here is a first attempt at drawing the histogram. faces = range(1, 7) plt.hist(faces) (array([1., 0., 1., 0., 1., 0., 1., 0., 1., 1.]), array([1. , 1.5, 2. , 2.5, 3. , 3.5, 4. , 4.5, 5. , 5.5, 6. ]), \u003cBarContainer object of 10 artists\u003e) This default plot is not helpful. We have to choose some arguments to get a visualization that we can interpret. Note that the second printed line shows the left ends of the default bins, as well as the right end of the last bin. The first line shows the counts in the bins. If you don’t want the printed lines you can add a semi-colon at the end of the call to plt.hist, but we’ll keep the lines for now. Let’s redraw the histogram with bins of unit length centered at the possible values. By the end of the exercise you’ll see a reason for centering. Notice that the argument for specifying bins is the same as the one for the Table method hist. unit_bins = np.arange(0.5, 6.6) plt.hist(faces, bins = unit_bins) (array([1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1.]), array([0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5]), \u003cBarContainer object of 6 artists\u003e) We need to see the edges of the bars! Let’s specify the edge color ec to be white. Here are all the colors you could use, but do try to drag yourself away from the poetic names. plt.hist(faces, bins = unit_bins, ec='white') (array([1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1.]), array([0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5]), \u003cBarContainer object of 6 artists\u003e) That’s much better, but look at the vertical axis. It is not drawn to the density scale defined in Data 8. We want a histogram of a probability distribution, so the total area should be 1. We just have to ask for that. plt.hist(faces, bins = unit_bins, ec='white', density=True) (array([0.16666667, 0.16666667, 0.16666667, 0.16666667, 0.16666667, 0.16666667]), array([0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5]), \u003cBarContainer object of 6 artists\u003e) That’s the probability histogram of the number of spots on one roll of a die.

That being said, Lecture 2 provides additional historical context and definitions for probability sample, sampling bias, and chance error). One way to use probability samples is to quantify sampling bias and chance error. Put briefly, if we assume that a sample distribution was selected at random from a known population, then we can quantify how likely that sample is to have arisen due to random chance (chance error). If the difference in sample and population distributions is too great, then we suspect that the given sample has bias in how it was selected from the population. Let’s see this process in a post-analysis of pre-election polling of the 1936 U.S. Presidential Election. Through the U.S. electoral college process (we’ll ignore it in this question, but read more here), Franklin D. Roosevelt won the election by an overwhelming margin. The popular vote results were approximately 61% Roosevelt (Democrat, incumbent), 37% Alf Landon (Republican), and 2% other candidates. For this problem, this is our population distribution. You can use np.random.multinomial to simulate drawing at random with replacement from a categorical distribution. The arguments are the sample size n and an array pvals of the proportions in all the categories. The function simulates n independent random draws from the distribution and returns the observed counts in all the categories. Read the documentation to see how this is described formally; we will use the formal terminology and notation in future assignments after we have discussed them in class. You will see that the function also takes a third argument size, which for our purposes will be an integer that specifies the number of times to run the entire simulation. All the runs are independent of each other. Write one line of code that uses np.random.multinomial to run 10 independent simulations of drawing 100 times at random with replacement from a population in which 61% of the people vote for Roosevelt, 37% for Landon, and 2% for other candidatdes. The output should be an array containing the counts in the Roosevelt category in the 10 simulations. It will help to recall how to slice NumPy arrays.

Note: In this course we often opt for $x$ instead of $\\vec{x}$ to simplify notation; $x$ as a vector is inferred from its use in the dot product. Then $x_i$ is the $i$-th element of the vector $x$. Detail: In this course, we prefer the notation $x^Ty$ to illustrate a dot product, defined as matrix multiplication of $x^T$ and $y$. In the literature you may also see $x \\cdot y$, but we avoid this notation since the dot ($\\cdot$) notation is occasionally used for scalar values. Detail: The dot product is a special case of an inner product, where $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. (2) We introduce a special vector, $\\mathbb{1}$, to write the mean $\\bar{x}$ of data $(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n)$ as a dot product: \\begin{align} \\bar{x} \u0026= \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n 1x_i \\ \u0026= \\frac{1}{n}(x^T\\mathbb{1}). \\end{align} The data $(x_1, \\dots, x_n)$ have been defined as an $n$-dimensional column vector $x$, where $x = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \\dots \\ x_n \\end{bmatrix}$. The special vector $\\mathbb{1}$ is a vector of ones, whose length is defined by the vector operation in which it is used. So with $n$-dimensional column vector $x$, the dot product $x^T\\mathbb{1}$ implies that $\\mathbb{1}$ is an $n$-dimensional column vector where every element is $1$. Because dot products produce scalars, the multiplication of two scalars $\\frac{1}{n}$ and $x^T\\mathbb{1}$ produces another scalar, $\\bar{x}$. Note: We use bar notation for the mean ($\\bar{x}$ instead of $\\mu$) in this problem to differentiate $\\bar{x}$ from $\\bar{y}$, the latter of which is the mean of data $(y_1, \\dots, y_n)$.

We’ve plotted the point using matplotlib’s scatter function, which you will see in more detail in two weeks. # Run this cell to plot the data. weight_lifted = np.array([ 37.5, 51.5, 61.3, 61.3, 63.6, 66.1, 70. , 92.7, 90.5, 90.5, 94.8, 97. , 97. , 97. , 102. , 102. , 103.6, 100.4, 108.4, 114. , 115.3, 114.9, 114.7, 123.6, 125.8, 119.1, 118.9, 141.1]) shot_put_distance = np.array([ 6.4, 10.2, 12.4, 13. , 13.2, 13. , 12.7, 13.9, 15.5, 15.8, 15.8, 16.8, 17.1, 17.8, 14.8, 15.5, 16.1, 16.2, 17.9, 15.9, 15.8, 16.7, 17.6, 16.8, 17. , 18.2, 19.2, 18.6]) plt.scatter(weight_lifted, shot_put_distance) plt.xlabel(\"Weight Lifted\") plt.ylabel(\"Shot Put Distance\") Looks pretty linear! Let’s try to fit a regression line to this data. Define the vectors $x$ as the weight lifted data vector and $y$ as the shot put distance data vector, respectively, of the college athletes. Then the regression line uses the weight lifted $x$ to predict $\\hat{y}$, which is the linear estimate of the actual value shot put distance $y$ as follows: \\begin{align} \\hat{y} \u0026= \\hat{a} + \\hat{b}{x}\\text{, where} \\ \\hat{a} \u0026= \\bar{y} - \\hat{b}\\bar{x} \\ \\hat{b} \u0026= r \\dfrac{\\sigma_y}{\\sigma_x} \\end{align} $\\bar{x}, \\bar{y}$ and $\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y$ are the means and standard deviations, respectively of the data $x$ and $y$, respectively. Here, $r$ is the correlation coefficient as defined in Data 8! Note: We use the hat $\\hat{}$ notation to indicate values we are estimating: $\\hat{y}$, the predicted shot put distance, as well as $\\hat{a}$ and $\\hat{b}$, the respective estimated intercept and slope parameters we are using to model the “best” linear predictor of $y$ from $x$. We’ll dive into this later in the course. Note: Remember how we dropped the $\\vec{}$ vector notation? These linear regression equations therefore represent both the scalar case (predict a single value $\\hat{y}$ from a single $x$) and the vector case (predict a vector $\\hat{y}$ element-wise from a vector $x$). How convenient!! In this part, instead of using NumPy’s built-in statistical functions like np.mean() and np.std(), you are going to use NumPy’s matrix operations to create the components of the regression line from first principles. The @ operator multiplies NumPy matrices or arrays together (documentation). We can use this operator to write functions to compute statistics on data, using the expressions that we defined in part (a). Check it out: # Just run this cell. def dot_mean(arr): n = len(arr) all_ones = np.ones(n) # creates n-dimensional vector of ones return (arr.T @ all_ones)/n def dot_var(arr): n = len(arr) mean = dot_mean(arr) zero_mean_arr = arr - mean return (zero_mean_arr.T @ zero_mean_arr)/n def dot_std(arr): return np.sqrt(dot_var(arr)) print(\"np.mean(weight_lifted) =\", np.mean(weight_lifted), \"\\tdot_mean(weight_lifted) =\", dot_mean(weight_lifted)) print(\"np.var(weight_lifted) =\", np.std(weight_lifted), \"\\tdot_var(weight_lifted =\", dot_var(weight_lifted)) print(\"np.std(weight_lifted) =\", np.std(weight_lifted), \"\\tdot_std(weight_lifted =\", dot_std(weight_lifted)) Now, you will write code to define the expressions you explored in part (a) of this question.

Each question has a response cell directly below it. Most response cells are followed by a test cell that runs automated tests to check your work. Please don’t delete questions, response cells, or test cells. You won’t get credit for your work if you do. If you have extra content in a response cell, such as an example call to a function you’re implementing, that’s fine. Also, feel free to add cells between the question cells and test cells (or the next cell, for questions without test cases). Any extra cells you add will be considered part of your submission. Finally, when you finish an assignment, make sure to “restart and run all cells” to ensure everything works properly. Note that for labs, ontime submissions that pass all the test cases will receive full credit. However for homeworks, test cells don’t always confirm that your response is correct. They are meant to give you some useful feedback, but it’s your responsibility to ensure your response answers the question correctly. There may be other tests that we run when scoring your notebooks.

Like Python lists, arrays store data; however, they store data in a more efficient manner. In many cases, this allows for faster computation and data manipulation. In Data 8, we used make_array from the datascience module, but that’s not the most typical way. Instead, use np.array to create an array. It takes a sequence, such as a list or range. Below, create an array arr containing the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (in that order). arr = np.array([1,2,3,4,5]) grader.check(\"q1\") q1 passed! 🌟 In addition to values in the array, we can access attributes such as shape and data type.

Given two or more arrays of equal length, arithmetic will perform element-wise computations across the arrays. For example, observe the following: # Python list addition will concatenate the two lists [1, 2, 3] + [4, 5, 6] [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] # NumPy array addition will add them element-wise np.array([1, 2, 3]) + np.array([4, 5, 6]) array([5, 7, 9]) ","date":"2024-07-13","objectID":"/datalab01/:2:3","tags":["Data 100","JupyterHub","Python","numpy","matplotlib"],"title":"DATA100-lab01","uri":"/datalab01/"},{"categories":["DATA100"],"content":"Question 2 Question 2a Write a function summation that evaluates the following summation for $n \\geq 1$: $$\\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^3 + 3 i^2$$ Note: You should not use for loops in your solution.

However, we will commonly be working with much larger datasets: sample_list_2 = list(range(100000)) sample_array_2 = np.arange(100000) %%time elementwise_list_sum(sample_list_2, sample_list_2) ; # The semicolon hides the output CPU times: total: 15.6 ms Wall time: 33.2 ms %%time elementwise_array_sum(sample_array_2, sample_array_2) CPU times: total: 0 ns Wall time: 557 μs array([ 0, 2, 12, ..., 999920002099982, 999950000799996, 999980000100000]) With the larger dataset, we see that using NumPy results in code that executes over 50 times faster! Throughout this course (and in the real world), you will find that writing efficient code will be important; arrays and vectorized operations are the most common way of making Python programs run quickly.
