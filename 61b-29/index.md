## Graph Problem so far

Punchline:
- ***DFS and BFS both traverse entire graphs, just in a different order*** (like preorder, inorder, postorder, and level order for trees).
- Solving graph problems is often a question of identifying the right traversal. Many traversals may work.
  - Example: DFS for topological sort. BFS for shortest paths.
  - Example: DFS or BFS about equally good for checking existence of path.
